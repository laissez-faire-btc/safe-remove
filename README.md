# a safe way to remove objectionable content from the blockchain

I propose two changes to Bitcoin, one at the consensus level, and one at the client level. The purpose of these changes is to support filtering of objectionable content after the content has been mined, allowing each node operator to maintain only that data they find agreeable. In so doing, my hope is that we can address all users' greatest concerns, for a true consensus resolution.

I do however acknowledge those people that want to stop miners from mining non-monetary transactions, because of the data storage and processing cost, and I recognised that this proposal does nothing to address those concerns.

**Motivation**

You can't just change or delete some data from the blockchain, because a hash of each transaction is in the transaction signature, and a hash of each block is in the next block. If you change the data, you change the hashes, and you break things.

The design presented here is an attempt to achieve a compromise, where a person can have all of the benefits of running a full archival node, including the integrity of the ledger, yet without storing the objectionable content - and importantly without even being able to recreate that objectionable content from what data they still have.

**Preliminary**

Objectionable content is defined here as whatever you decide it is, and two users don't have to share the same views. One person might object to copyrighted material used without permission, another a negative depiction of the prophet Muhammad, and another video of the sexual abuse of children. The design presented below lets each person decide what to remove for themself (if anything), while those who want everything still have it all.

**Solution**

If you take some arbitrary data that's in a transaction, written into the blockchain, and you change part of it (e.g. to all zeros) to remove some objectionable content, then you also change any hash that it's been used in. For example, that might be signatures in transaction inputs, or a transaction hash in a block's Merkel tree.

The solution presented below is based on two ideas, both aimed at maintaining data and signature integrity through hashing, while changing some of the hash's input data.

**First idea**

If you know that changing the data from D to D' changes the hash from H to H', and if you confirm that D' hashes to H', then you know that H is the correct hash of the original data D, even without seeing D. If you know all that, then you can safely update D to D', removing the objectionable content. You can still confirm that the only thing that changed was the change you knew about. With that knowledge you can continue to validate a signature, or you can use the original hash in construction of a Merkel tree.

Of course that's a big 'if', at the beginning of that paragraph. That 'if' is doing a lot of work.

The easiest way to obtain D' and H' securely is to generate them yourself: update D to D' to remove the objectionable content, hash D' into H' (while keeping a copy of H). But that has multiple problems. You have to hold the objectionable data, at least for a time. There's also no evidence that the original D ever hashed to H, beyond the fact that you hold D' and H'. You certainly don't have any evidence that could be shared and used by anyone else.

But what if instead, we could share H' across the network, and do it securely and verifiably, and in a way where up to 100% of nodes could choose to make this change to D, permanently, without breaking anything?

**Second idea**

It may seem like there is no one you can trust to tell you what H' is. There is only one source of data that a Bitcoin node can trust, and that is the blockchain, as mined by miners, with the most proof of work, and verified locally. Therefore, the second idea is that H' can be trusted if (and only if) it is written into the blockchain, and verified by the network.

For example, we write data to the semantic effect of "In Transaction X: changing data (to all zeros) between byte offset A and byte offset B has the effect of changing the transaction hash to H', and the transaction signatures' signed hash values to S1', S2' ... Sn'." Miners then validate and mine this statement into a block, and verifiers confirm that it is cryptographically accurate with respect to the data in Transaction X, as described - or else they drop the new block as invalid.

Once this statement is established in the blockchain, any node can choose to delete (change to all zeros) the data between A and B in Transaction X. This can now be done with confidence because they can double check the accuracy, and the impact on the ledger, before they delete the data. After that they may also be able to share (with the agreement of the receiving node) Transaction X as part of initial block downloads - along with H', S1', S2' ... Sn' - to any other nodes that don't want the objectionable content. The receiving nodes wouldn't immediately and necessarily be able to verify and rely on H' etc., but they would eventually, once they have the full blockchain.

**Putting it all together**

Here's some very loose pseudocode showing the steps to remove the objectionable content:
1: write the following to the blockchain:
1.a: the transaction (T) to be changed 
1.b: the exact data (D) to be changed, specified by byte offset, and length (or multiple byte offsets, and lengths)
1.c: the current hash (H) of T
1.d: the new hash (H') of T, after D is changed
1.e: for any signatures that sign D (for example, signatures in transaction inputs), the current hash (S) and the new hash (S') of that signed data (the signed data includes D, but the hash of the signed data is different to the hash of D, and different to the hash of T)
2: miners and validators check that this represents a true statement about T, D, H, H', S, S', and the change is safe (e.g. it is arbitrary data, not structural), and it is written into a block
3: a client sees this removal and chooses to use it, additionally confirming that the removal is valid and safe
4: a client may further share this transaction or this block in future, in its altered state, along with the information necessary to validate it in its altered state (which will be found and can be confirmed later in the blockchain)
