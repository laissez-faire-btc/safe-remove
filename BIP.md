The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

Note that the force of these words is modified by the requirement level of the document in which they are used. In this case, that requirement level is a soft fork, meaning that node implementations MAY ignore this BIP entirely, including all of its requirements.

## Abstract

This Specification BIP defines a new type of transaction output to enable nodes to safely and robustly redact objectionable content from the blockchain (within reason).

Any participant MAY write a _Redaction Statement_ to the blockchain. A Redaction Statement specifies which bytes of data will be redacted from the blockchain, and exactly how to safely redact those bytes. Once this is committed to the blockchain, any participant MAY apply the Redaction Statement to safely redact the specified content from their node.

Where two participants wish to redact the same content, redacted data MAY be shared between nodes, in redacted form; for example, as part of an initial block download.

The elements of the Redaction Statement workflow (including writing, mining, confirming, applying and sharing redaction statements) are each verifiable, trustless operations, that do not rely on any third party or authority.

## Motivation

**What problem does Safe Redaction address?**

Bitcoin is money for everybody, but the current rules require that to be a full participant, to run an archival node, to contribute to the resilience of the network, to be entirely self sufficient, you must be willing to hold any arbitrary data that is mined, no matter how objectionable. There are, no doubt, people and businesses who would like to join the network, but will not do so under these rules, because they cannot currently do so safely.

**How does Safe Redaction improve things?**

This BIP provides a means to redact objectionable content, with minimal impact, in line with the following design goals:

* optional - each node gets to decide what to redact, if anything 
* safe - provably no harm is done to those not choosing to use it, and any cost or risk to those using it is well understood, minimal, and mitigated
* full node functionality - a node that does redact content can still do everything it could have done otherwise, without relying on anyone else
* retrospective - content that exists on the blockchain today (pre-implementation) can be redacted later (post-implementation)
* trustless, verifiable, permissionless - Redaction Statements enabling data to be redacted are simple verifiable statements of fact that can be written by anybody
* lightweight - minimal changes and impact to policy, consensus, implementation, usage, the economy
* granularity, associativity, commutability, idempotence - the least possible data is redacted, and the ordering of Redaction Statements is inconsequential
* transferable - nodes that choose to redact objectionable content can share those blocks (with content removed) with others who hold the same objection, so that the receiver may never even momentarily hold the objectionable content

## Specification

**How does Safe Redaction work?**

## Security Implications ##

**What's the impact on security? What new attacks are possible, and can they be mitigated?**

## Rationale

**Why is this the right solution to the problem?**

This proposal doesn't impose any definition of objectionable content on anyone, or any process for determining what should count as objectionable. This is entirely up to each individual to decide for themself.


* even miners can apply redactions, which will help with global diversification and miner decentralisation

## Backward Compatibility

**How will activation work, and how will we know it has happened?**

**How will existing nodes and existing blocks handle this?**

## Reference Implementation

**Has this been implemented, in any way, shape or form?**

## Changelog

* __v0.0.0__ (2025-12-25):
  * initial draft

**"Redactable Blockchain in the Permissionless Setting", Deuber et al, 2019,** [https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03206](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03206)

An academic proposal to enable redaction through a hard fork. It would change Bitcoin by adding an additional Merkel tree of redacted data into the block header. It relied on a central authority to decide what to redact, and then redactions would be applied to all nodes.

**"Redactable Blockchain: Comprehensive Review, Mechanisms, Challenges, Open Issues and Future Research Directions", Abd Ali et al, 2023,** [https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/15/1/35](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/15/1/35)

This is a recent literature review that considers various methods of redacting blockchains (including Bitcoin). It goes into depth about the various reasons that a participant may want to redact content. It also demonstrates that (as of 2023) there were no realistic and practical solutions to this problem.
