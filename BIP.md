## Abstract

This **Specification BIP** defines a new type of transaction output to enable nodes to safely and robustly redact objectionable content from the blockchain (within reason).

Any participant MAY write a _Redaction Statement_ to the blockchain. A Redaction Statement specifies which bytes of data will be redacted from the blockchain, and exactly how to safely redact those bytes. Once this transaction is committed to the blockchain, any participant MAY apply the Redaction Statement to safely redact the specified content from their node.

Where two participants wish to redact the same content, redacted data can be shared between nodes, for example as part of an initial block download.

The elements of the Redaction Statement workflow (including writing, mining, confirming, applying and sharing redaction statements) are each verifiable, trustless operations, that do not rely on any third party.

## Motivation

What problem does Safe Redaction address?

## Specification

How does Safe Redaction work?

## Rationale

Why is this the right solution to the redaction problem?

## Backward Compatibility

How will existing nodes and existing blocks handle this?

## Reference Implementation

Has this been implemented, in any way, shape or form?

## Changelog

**"Redactable Blockchain in the Permissionless Setting", Deuber et al, 2019,** [https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03206](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03206)

An academic proposal to enable redaction through a hard fork. It would change Bitcoin by adding an additional Merkel tree of redacted data into the block header. It relied on a central authority to decide what to redact, and then redactions would be applied to all nodes.

**"Redactable Blockchain: Comprehensive Review, Mechanisms, Challenges, Open Issues and Future Research Directions", Abd Ali et al, 2023,** [https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/15/1/35](https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/15/1/35)

This is a recent literature review that considers various methods of redacting blockchains (including Bitcoin). It goes into depth about the various reasons that a participant may want to redact content. It also demonstrates that (as of 2023) there were no realistic and practical solutions to this problem.
