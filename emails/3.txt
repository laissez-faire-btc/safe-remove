Hi Greg, Ethan, Saint, Peter, AdamISZ, Erik, list

I emailed a detailed update on this proposal, as a reply to my original email, five days ago and it doesn't seem to have gotten through. At first I thought it must be on hold with the "light moderation" of this list, but now that thought is getting ridiculous. Does anyone know why an email might get lost in limbo like that here? It was in-reply-to my original email.

And what to do about it? Should I start a new thread with the update? Reply to my original email again and expect a different result? Reply to a different reply in this thread?

I included a link to my Discord server for chattier discussion - could that induce hard moderation?

Thanks everyone.

(Assuming this email gets through to you, of course!)
